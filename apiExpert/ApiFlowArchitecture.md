# API Expert Flow Architecture

## Overview
The API Expert flow is designed to handle basic HTTP GET and POST API interactions within the Autogen Studio environment. This flow leverages pre-existing Python skills to manage API requests and responses, focusing on data retrieval (GET) and submission (POST) operations.

## Available Methods

### 1. GET Operations
- Data retrieval from external APIs
- Parameter handling and query string formatting
- Response parsing and data extraction
- Cached responses for improved performance

### 2. POST Operations
- Data submission to external APIs
- Request body formatting and validation
- Response handling and confirmation
- Error handling and retry logic

## Flow Components

### 1. API Flow Orchestrator
- Determines whether to use GET or POST method
- Coordinates request flow between agents
- Manages operation state and error handling
- Uses skills: Request Routing, Error Management

### 2. API Integration Specialist
- Executes GET and POST requests
- Handles authentication and headers
- Manages request/response cycle
- Uses skills: API Authentication, Request Execution

### 3. API Response Manager
- Processes API responses
- Formats data according to requirements
- Implements basic response caching
- Uses skills: Response Formatting, Data Validation

## Flow Diagrams

### GET Operation Flow
```mermaid

    participant User
    participant AFO as API Flow Orchestrator
    participant AIS as API Integration Specialist
    participant ARM as API Response Manager
    participant Cache as Response Cache

    User->>AFO: GET Request
    AFO->>Cache: Check Cache
    alt Cache Hit
        Cache->>AFO: Return Cached Response
        AFO->>User: Cached Result
    else Cache Miss
        AFO->>AIS: Forward GET Request
        AIS->>External: GET API Call
        External->>AIS: Raw Response
        AIS->>ARM: Process Response
        ARM->>Cache: Store Response
        ARM->>AFO: Formatted Response
        AFO->>User: Final Result
    end
```

### POST Operation Flow
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant AFO as API Flow Orchestrator
    participant AIS as API Integration Specialist
    participant ARM as API Response Manager

    User->>AFO: POST Request
    AFO->>AIS: Validate & Forward
    AIS->>External: POST API Call
    External->>AIS: Response
    AIS->>ARM: Process Response
    ARM->>AFO: Formatted Response
    AFO->>User: Final Result
```

### Required Skills Per Operation

    GET Operations

      Request Skills
        Parameter Formatting
        Query Building
      Response Skills
        Data Extraction
        Cache Management
    POST Operations
      ::icon(fa fa-upload)
      Request Skills
        Body Formatting
        Data Validation
      Response Skills
        Status Handling
        Error Processing
```

## Flow Sequence
1. User initiates GET or POST request
2. Orchestrator determines method and required skills
3. Integration Specialist executes the API call
4. Response Manager processes and formats the response
5. Result returned to user

## Integration Points
- Uses existing Python skills for API interactions
- Implements basic caching for GET requests
- Handles standard HTTP headers and authentication
- Supports JSON request/response formats

## Error Handling
- Request validation errors
- API connection failures
- Response timeout handling
- Invalid data format handling

## Performance Considerations
- GET request caching
- Response size optimization
- Basic rate limiting
- Connection pooling
